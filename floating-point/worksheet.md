# Worksheet 3 - Floating Point

## 1. Pre-Check

This section is designed as a conceptual check for you to determine if you conceptually understand and have any misconceptions about this topic. Please answer true/false to the following questions, and include an explanation:

### 1.1. True or False. The goals of floating point are to have a large range of values, a low amount of precision, and real arithmetic results

**Ans**: False. The goal is to have a large range of values, with high precision and approximate results.

### 1.2. True or False. The distance between floating point numbers increase as the absolute value of the numbers increase.

**Ans**: True. The exponent part of the number helps to represent a large range of numbers, but it also dictates by how much they are separated.

### 1.3. True or False. Floating Point addition is associative.

**Ans**: False. The approximations make the addition a non-associative operation.
